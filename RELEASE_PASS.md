# Release Pass

Cross-session task log. Before starting any work, write open items here with `[ ]`.
Mark `[x]` when done. Keep this file next to `CLAUDE.md` so it survives context compaction.

This is the canonical log — it does not live in companion repos.

Durable architectural decisions that a future agent can't read from the code belong in
`CLAUDE.md`'s "Non-obvious decisions" section, not here — that section is the permanent
record; this file is scratch space for the pass currently in flight. Clear this file
once a pass's items are all `[x]` and anything worth keeping has been migrated there.

## Status key

- [x] Done
- [ ] Open
- [~] Partial

## Current pass — open items

_(none — start a new pass by writing open items here before beginning multi-step work)_

---

## Starting a new pass

All prior work is on `main` in each repo. Create a new branch from `main` in each repo at the start of the next pass.
